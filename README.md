***If you can fix that odd error that would be great! Also, I wasn't able to make it save according to the assignment spec from the file stated above

ALSO for students from Carleton who are from the same program: If you are looking at this right now, be aware of the plagerism policy that Carleton has. If you attempt to copy code and use it for your own academic assignments or such, then you and I will both in trouble for breaking the policy. Therefore, I highly advise to stray away from looking at this so not only it will save our academic career, but yours as well.
